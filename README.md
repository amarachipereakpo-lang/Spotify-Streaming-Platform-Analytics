2️⃣ Track Popularity by Album Type
Here, we’re comparing popularity across album types.
Albums have the highest popularity score, followed by singles, and compilations are the least popular.
So full album releases tend to perform best with listeners.

Next, the explicit content breakdown.
About 75% of the tracks are clean, while 25% are explicit.
So the majority of music in this dataset is non-explicit.

4️⃣ Track Duration vs Popularity
In this table, we’re looking at the most popular tracks and their durations.
We can see top tracks like ‘Wildest Dreams’, ‘Die With A Smile’, and ‘Sports Car’ — and many of them are fairly long, between 8 to 18 minutes.
So longer, impactful songs seem to attract strong engagement.

Here, we have the top artists ranked by followers.
Taylor Swift leads with about 31.7k followers, followed by artists like The Weeknd, Lana Del Rey, Ariana Grande, and Drake.
Most of these artists release albums and fall under major genres like pop, R&B, and rap.

Album releases increase steadily every year — from 143 in 2020 to 429 in 2025.
Singles and compilations stay much lower.
